# Algorithms for Machine Learning (CAP 4611)

## Overview

Welcome to my **CAP 4611: Algorithms for Machine Learning** repository! This repository showcases my understanding of machine learning concepts and my ability to apply these techniques in real-world scenarios, as demonstrated through the assignments and projects I completed during this course. 

The course provides an in-depth exploration of commonly used machine learning algorithms across supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning paradigms. It also covers experimental design, evaluation metrics, and data preparation techniques. The Jupyter Notebooks in this repository reflect my hands-on experience with implementing these algorithms and working with real datasets.
